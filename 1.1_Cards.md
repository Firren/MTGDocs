# Cards

All functions will return an array with one or more objects.

## Get by Id

/cards/id/:id

If you want to find the id for a card you can try to do a search against the API by card name, explained later in this chapter.
The id can also be found by searching for a card at http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx. 
You will get a link looking like the value of gatherer_link below.
